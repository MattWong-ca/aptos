# 🗣️ About
Lingocaster is a language learning game on Farcaster. Learn a new language by translating posts from your social feed! The game itself is built using Farcaster frames triggered by this [cast action](https://warpcast.com/~/add-cast-action?url=https://lingo-cast.vercel.app/api/action).

<br/>
<br/>
We use AI to create translations + quiz questions from any post, which leads to personalized learning integrated into the real-world contexts of your own social feed. By building on Farcaster, we make language learning more social + cultural, and it also helps get more users through viral loops, Frames, and more. By leveraging Aptos, we ensure that users will have a fast + efficient UX when minting NFT streaks + buying in-game items, making this scalable to millions.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
- ⛓️ **Aptos**: deployed Move contracts for NFT streaks, in-game purchases, & challenge bets.
- 🐸 **Frog**: framework used for building Farcaster frames.
- 🪐 **Neynar**: used their SDK for fetching post text + building @Lingocaster bot.
- ✨ **OpenAI**: used for generating translations + quiz questions.
- 🗄️ **Supabase**: storing user info alongside smart contracts.
- 🎨 **Canva**: designing the frames images.

# 🗺️ Next Steps
1. **Passkeys**: in the future, integrating Passkeys will enable users to create an onchain account associated with their WebAuthn credential and sign transactions with it. This makes the UX even smoother with biometrics!
2. **Frames Enhancements**: sometimes the Farcaster frames take a while to load due to the OpenAI requests (and potentially the frequent images), so these will be optimized to provide a faster UX for users.
3. **Sharing Features**: 1-click sharing features of milestones and streaks will create viral loops, which helps with growing the number of users. This will bring more of Farcaster's crypto-native community onto Aptos!
