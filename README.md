# üó£Ô∏è About
Lingocaster is a language learning game on Farcaster. Learn a new language by translating posts from your social feed! The game itself is built using Farcaster frames triggered by this [cast action](https://warpcast.com/~/add-cast-action?url=https://lingo-cast.vercel.app/api/action). We use AI to create translations + quiz questions for users, who can then play for daily points and compete on the leaderboard. 

Using AI, we generate translations + quiz questions from any post, which leads to personalized learning integrated into the real-world contexts of your own social feed. By building on Farcaster, we make language learning more social + cultural, and it  also helps get more users through viral loops, Frames, and more. By leveraging Aptos, we ensure that users will have a fast + efficient UX when minting NFT streaks + buying in-game items, making this scalable to millions.
